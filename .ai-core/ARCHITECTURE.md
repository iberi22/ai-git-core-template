# 🏗️ Architecture

## 🚨 CRITICAL DECISIONS - READ FIRST

> ⚠️ **STOP!** Before implementing ANY feature, verify against this table.
> These decisions are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

| # | Category | Decision | Rationale | ❌ NEVER Use |
|---|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Hosting | GitHub Pages | Zero cost, Git-native | Vercel, Netlify, AWS |
| 2 | Backend | Supabase | BaaS, realtime | Firebase, custom API |
| 3 | State | GitHub Issues | Token economy | TODO.md, JIRA |

### How to use this table:
1. **Before ANY implementation**, check if it conflicts with decisions above
2. If issue mentions alternatives (e.g., "Vercel/GitHub Pages"), the decision above WINS
3. When in doubt, ASK - don't assume

## Stack
- **Language:** Rust (gc-cli), PowerShell/Bash (legacy scripts)
- **Framework:** Clap 4.5 (CLI), Tokio (async runtime), Octocrab (GitHub API)
- **Database:** GitHub Issues (state management), None (local - stateless)
- **Infrastructure:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD), GitHub Pages (hosting)

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: [Title]
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Context:** Why this decision was needed
- **Decision:** What was decided
- **Consequences:** Impact and trade-offs

### Decision 2: Telemetry Migration to Rust
- **Date:** 2025-12-16
- **Context:** Telemetry logic was isolated in PowerShell, causing fragmentation and platform dependencies.
- **Decision:** Migrated client-side telemetry to `gc telemetry` command in Rust.
- **Consequences:** Unified toolchain in `gc-cli`, removed PowerShell dependency for telemetry submission. Legacy script `send-telemetry.ps1` is deprecated.

### Decision 3: CLI Unification
- **Date:** 2025-12-16
- **Context:** Multiple PowerShell scripts (`init_project.ps1`, `equip-agent.ps1`, `ai-report.ps1`) created maintenance overhead and platform lock-in.
- **Decision:** Consolidated all core workflows into `gc-cli` Rust binary (`gc init`, `gc context`, `gc report`, `gc ci-detect`).
- **Consequences:** All legacy PowerShell scripts are deprecated. Future development focuses solely on `gc-cli`.

## Dependencies
| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|----------|
| clap | 4.5.x | CLI argument parsing |
| tokio | 1.48.x | Async runtime |
| octocrab | 0.48.x | GitHub API client |
| serde | 1.0.x | Serialization |
| color-eyre | 0.6.x | Error handling |
| walkdir | 2.x | Directory traversal |

## Integration Points
- [ ] External API 1
- [ ] External API 2

## Security Considerations
- GitHub tokens stored in environment variables only
- No secrets committed to repository
- Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental credential exposure
- CLI uses HTTPS for all API calls
