## [Unreleased]

## [3.2.0] - 2025-12-07 📚 "Diátaxis Documentation System"

### Added

- **📚 Diátaxis Framework Adoption**: Complete documentation reorganization
  - `docs/tutorials/` - Learning-oriented guides (learn by doing)
  - `docs/how-to/` - Task-oriented guides (solve problems)
  - `docs/reference/` - Information-oriented docs (look up facts)
  - `docs/explanation/` - Understanding-oriented content (understand "why")
  - Each quadrant has README.md with clear principles and guidelines
  - `docs/DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md` - Complete explanation of the new system
  - `docs/wiki/Home.md` - GitHub Wiki homepage ready for publication

### Changed

- **Documentation Structure Overhaul**:
  - Migrated `ATOMIC_COMMITS.md` → `tutorials/` (learning-oriented)
  - Migrated `SESSION_EXPORT.md` → `how-to/` (task-oriented)
  - Migrated `COMMIT_STANDARD.md` → `reference/` (information-oriented)
  - Migrated `CLI_TRUST.md` → `explanation/` (understanding-oriented)
  - Updated `docs/README.md` with Diátaxis visual map and navigation
  - Kept `agent-docs/` separate for AI agent technical specifications

### Documentation

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - Humans: Organized by learning needs (4 Diátaxis quadrants)
  - AI Agents: Technical specs in `agent-docs/` unchanged
  - Clear distinction between tutorials, how-tos, reference, and explanations
  
- **GitHub Wiki Ready**:

  - Links to all documentation organized by type

### Benefits

- ✅ Clear navigation - Users know exactly where to look
- ✅ No content confusion - Tutorials don't mix with reference
- ✅ Scalable structure - Easy to add new docs without ambiguity
- ✅ Industry standard - Diátaxis used by Google, Cloudflare, Gatsby

### Migration Guide

See `docs/explanation/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION.md` for how to handle existing project docs.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-07 🎯 "Adaptive Workflows"

### Added

- **🎯 Adaptive Workflow System**: Intelligent resource optimization for GitHub Actions
  - `scripts/detect-repo-config.ps1` - PowerShell detector for Windows
  - `scripts/detect-repo-config.sh` - Bash detector for Linux/macOS
  - `.github/workflows/_repo-config.yml` - Reusable configuration workflow
  - Automatic detection of repository visibility (public/private)
  - Three-tier scheduling modes:
    - **AGGRESSIVE** (public repos): Full schedules, multi-repo monitoring, unlimited
    - **MODERATE** (private main repo): 6-hourly schedules, ~3,000 min/month
    - **CONSERVATIVE** (other private): Event-based only, ~600 min/month
  - Zero-configuration for users - fully automatic adaptation
  - Cross-platform support (PowerShell + Bash)

### Changed

- **Optimized `global-self-healing.yml`**:
  - Migrated primary trigger from `schedule` to `workflow_run` (FREE - only runs when needed)
  - Added adaptive scheduling (every 30min/6h/off based on repo type)
  - Reduced consumption from 18,000 to 600 min/month for private repos (97% savings)
  - Smart repository list selection based on schedule mode

- **Optimized `email-cleanup.yml`**:
  - Variable frequency: hourly (aggressive) / 6-hourly (moderate) / daily (conservative)
  - Repository type detection before execution
  - Reduced from 120 to 5 min/day for private repos

- **Optimized `copilot-meta-analysis.yml`**:
  - Schedule reduced from hourly to 6-hourly
  - Disabled schedules for private repos (event-based only)
  - Added pre-flight check to skip unnecessary runs

- **All workflows**:
  - Added `timeout-minutes` to prevent hanging jobs consuming resources
  - Repository type detection at job start
  - Smart skip logic for private repos in conservative mode

### Performance

- **Public repositories**: No change (unlimited Actions minutes) ✅
- **Private main repository**: 83% reduction (18,000 → 3,000 min/month)
- **Other private repositories**: 97% reduction (18,000 → 600 min/month) ✅
- Maintains 100% functionality via intelligent event-based triggers

### Documentation

- Added `docs/ADAPTIVE_WORKFLOWS.md` - Complete guide with:
  - System architecture and flow diagrams
  - Schedule mode details and comparisons
  - Installation instructions for new and existing projects
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Usage examples and best practices

  - Auto-retry for transient errors (timeouts, rate limits)
  - Auto-fix for dependency issues (creates PR with lockfile updates)
  - Auto-fix for linting issues (runs formatters, creates PR)
  - Creates issues for code/test failures requiring manual intervention
  - `deploy-self-healing.ps1` script for multi-repo deployment

- **📧 Email Handler**: Gmail integration for workflow failure notifications
