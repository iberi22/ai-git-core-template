# 🏗️ Architecture

## 🚨 CRITICAL DECISIONS - READ FIRST

> ⚠️ **STOP!** Before implementing ANY feature, verify against this table.
> These decisions are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

| # | Category | Decision | Rationale | ❌ NEVER Use |
|---|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Hosting | GitHub Pages | Zero cost, Git-native | Vercel, Netlify, AWS |
| 2 | Backend | Supabase | BaaS, realtime | Firebase, custom API |
| 3 | State | GitHub Issues | Token economy | TODO.md, JIRA |

### How to use this table:
1. **Before ANY implementation**, check if it conflicts with decisions above
2. If issue mentions alternatives (e.g., "Vercel/GitHub Pages"), the decision above WINS
3. When in doubt, ASK - don't assume
